This is the backend for the Demo MERN application using Node.js, Express, and Mongoose.

In the `src` controllers, we've utilized various packages. For authentication, we've employed JWT tokens, used cookie-parser to store cookies, connected to Cloudinary for cloud services, and utilized Multer for storing multipart form data locally, among other packages.

For video uploads and other image files such as avatar images, cover images, and thumbnails, we've utilized a third-party cloud service called Cloudinary. Cloudinary provides public URLs for the uploaded files like videos, avatar images, cover images, and thumbnails, etc.

In this project, three middleware functions have been implemented:

1. **Authentication Middleware:**
   This middleware authenticates the user for every route that requires user login. The approach involves storing the necessary tokens in cookies using the cookie parser during a successful user login. The middleware then authenticates the user's validity on every subsequent request.

2. **Multer Middleware:**
   Multer is a Node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, primarily used for file uploads. It is built on top of busboy for maximum efficiency. More information can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer).

3. **isOwnerOfContent Middleware:**
   This custom middleware is used for delete operations. It ensures that only the owner of the content, such as tweets, comments, playlists, and videos, has permission to delete their own content. If another user attempts to delete the content, an error is thrown.

Additionally, there are utility files in the `utils` folder. The `apiResponse` file provides a standardized API response for better understanding on the frontend. Another file, `apiError`, handles API errors to facilitate frontend error handling.

There's also a utility file named `cloudinary`. This file is used for uploading video files, avatar images, cover images, thumbnails, etc. It is configured with the Cloudinary package. More information about Cloudinary can be found here https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudinary or on its official site https://cloudinary.com.

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project to your local machine.
2. Install the required node modules by running the command `npm i`. Note that the node module version should be greater than 16.3.
3. Install other dependencies like Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Nodemon, `mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2` for pagination, Multer for handling multipart form data, Bcrypt for password encryption and decryption, Cloudinary, `cloudinary-build-url`, `cookie-parser` for storing access tokens in cookies, CORS for handling Google's CORS policy, `dotenv` for configuring the environment file, and `jsonwebtoken (JWT)` for generating JWT tokens for authentication.

After installing dependencies, configure your environment file with your API keys and database connection string. Then, run the command `npm run start` to start your local server connected to MongoDB. You can test your API in Postman and other cross-platform tools.
